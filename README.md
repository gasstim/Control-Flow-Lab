# Control-Flow-Lab
A lab for Oswego's Systems Programming course CSC322. This lab replicates a simple comand prompt.
This program is made to recognize 3 commands. Two which begin their own respective numbers games.
The third is "quit" which acts as a "ctrl + c" of sorts, and can be called at any point.
This lab is relevant to the "Exceptional control flow" portion of the 
"Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective" book.
